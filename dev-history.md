# 📜 Development History: Credit Approval ML Pipeline

This document tracks the evolution of the project from its initial monolithic state to a professional, enterprise-grade MLOps hybrid architecture.

## 🏗️ Phase 1: Foundation & Modularization
- **Initial Setup**: Initialization of the Git repository and standard project structure (`src/`, `configs/`, `data/`).
- **Core Package**: Implementation of `PipelineConfig` and `setup_logger` for centralized configuration and logging.
- **Data Layer**: Creation of `RobustDataLoader` and `DataValidator` to ensure data quality and prevent leakage via temporal splitting.
- **Feature Engineering**: Implementation of a modular `FeatureEngineer` class to handle complex financial transformations and preprocessing.

## 🚀 Phase 2: Enterprise Feature Integration (V3.5 Port)
- **Business Logic**: Ported the deep financial modeling logic into `src/evaluation/business.py`, including **ROI**, **NPV**, and **Payback Period** calculations.
- **Statistical Rigor**: Integrated the **Friedman Test** with Bonferroni correction for mathematically sound model comparison.
- **Intelligent Selection**: Added `ModelSelector` and `FinalValidator` to assess deployment readiness based on multi-criteria scoring.
- **Advanced Visuals**: Implemented the **12-Panel Business Dashboard** and **6-Panel Selection Dashboard** in `visualizer.py` for stakeholder reporting.

## ☁️ Phase 3: Colab Optimization & UX
- **Hybrid Entry Points**: Optimized `main.ipynb` to serve as a premium interface for Google Colab, including automated path detection and dashboard rendering.
- **Documentation Overhaul**: Restored the `README.md` to its full industrial depth and created a dedicated `COLAB.md` guide.
- **Git Strategy**: Adjusted `.gitignore` to balance security (ignoring raw data) and visibility (including pipeline outputs and dashboards).

## 🛡️ Phase 5: MLOps Finalization & Modernization (2026-02-04)
- **Advanced Modeling Integration**: Successfully unified the V3.5 Enterprise modeling (ROI, NPV, Payback) into the modular `src/evaluation` layer.
- **Enterprise Diagnostics**: Implemented `ConfidenceAnalyzer` for probabilistic risk profiling and SHAP-based `ModelInterpretabilityAnalyzer` for compliance.
- **Serving & MLOps**: Developed the `src/serving` utility layer, introducing `DeploymentPackager` and `ProductionValidator` to ensure "Deploy-Ready" artifacts.
- **Infrastructure Overhaul**: Optimized `docker/Dockerfile` for secure production environments and aligned `requirements.txt` with all diagnostic tools.
- **Automated Sync**: Developed automation to synchronize the `main.ipynb` display layer with the dynamic enterprise dashboards generated by the pipeline.

## 📈 Major Milestones
1.  **Monolith to Modular**: Successfully moved all core logic out of notebook cells into a testable Python package.
2.  **Enterprise Parity**: Achieved 100% feature parity with the original V3.5 project while improving code quality and adding confidence diagnostics.
3.  **Production Ready**: Added fully automated deployment packaging and Docker health checks, making the project ready for enterprise scale.
